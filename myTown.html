                        scholars
                        differ on the chronology of its original construction, it was most likely founded in the 8th

                        under
                        the Aghlabid dynasty. Although a large number of ribats were built in the region during that
                        period, the Ribat of Sousse is by far the best-preserved.</p>

                        period. The mosque was renovated and its prayer hall expanded multiple times over the
                        following

                    <p class="text-center">Sousse or Soussa (Arabic: سوسة) is a city in Tunisia, capital
                        of the Sousse Governorate. Located 140 km (87 mi) south of the capital Tunis, the city has
                        271,428 inhabitants (2014). Sousse is in the central-east of the country, on the Gulf of
                        Hammamet, which is a part of the Mediterranean Sea. Its economy is based on transport
                        equipment,
                        processed food, olive oil, textiles, and tourism. It is home to the Université de Sousse</p>
                    <h2 class="text-center">Geography</h2>
                    <p class="text-center">Sousse is in the center of Tunisia, on the Tunisian Sahel coast and on
                        the
                        Mediterranean Sea bordering the east of the country. The city covers 45 km2 and is 25 meters
                        above sea level.</p>
                    <P> Sousse is between two wadis: the Wadi Bliban (and its tributary the Wadi al-Kharrub) to the
                        north and northwest and the Wadi al-Halluf to the southeast. The subsoil is mostly
                        sedimentary with some deep alluvial deposits, which are more recent closer to the coast.
                        Winters are generally mild, there is an average of 69 days of rainfall per year, and there
                        is a
                        lot of sunshine year-round with relatively few cloudy days.</P>
                    <P>Administration</P>
                    <P>The Municipality of Sousse is the capital of a governorate that extends over 2669 km2. It is
                        divided into four municipal districts: Sousse Nord, Sousse Sud, Sousse Médina and Sousse
                        Riadh. The first two were created on 11 February 1976 and the last two on 19 February 1982.
                        Its
                        main constituencies and Delegation are four in number: Sousse Sidi Abdelhamid, Sousse
                        Médina,
                        Sousse Jawhara and Sousse Riadh. Its geographic code is 31.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-center">History</h2>
                    <P>Medieval Susa</P>
                    <P> Muslim Arab armies rapidly spread Arab culture across what had been a thoroughly Romanized
                        and
                        Christianized landscape. Under the Aghlabids, Susa was established near the ruins of
                        Hadrumetum
                        and served as their main port. Their 827 invasion of Sicily was mainly launched from the
                        town's
                        harbor. After the Byzantine city of Melite (modern Mdina on Malta) was captured by the
                        Aghlabids
                        in 870, marble from its churches was used to build the Ribat. A soaring structure that
                        combined the purposes of a minaret and a watch tower, it remains in outstanding condition
                        and
                        draws visitors from around the world. Its mosque is sometimes accounted the oldest surviving
                        in
                        the region and the town's main mosque, also built during the 9th century, has a similarly
                        fortress-like appearance.

                        Susa was briefly occupied by Norman Sicily in the 12th century; it fell to the Ottoman
                        Empire in
                        the 16th; and it was bombarded by a French and Venetian fleet in the 18th.

                        Medieval Susa was known for its textile industries, producing silk and flax fabrics called
                        Sūsī.
                        Especially renowned were its robes called shuqqas, some of which were mass-produced and sold
                        ready-to-wear throughout the Mediterranean.

                        After the decline of Mahdia in the 15th and 16th centuries, Susa remained as the most
                        important
                        town in the Sahel region, with a population of about 15,000.</P>

                    <P> Colonial Sousse </P>

                    <P>Damage to the port of Sousse after an Allied bombing raid, June 1943
                        Tunisia became a French protectorate in 1881. Around the end of the 19th century, Sousse had
                        a
                        population of 7,000 and was the second-most-important city in Tunisia after Tunis itself. At
                        this point, the entire population of Sousse lived in the walled medina The medina was
                        surrounded by agricultural settlements, two of which - Kala Kebira and Msaken - were more
                        densely populated than the city itself. The French Protectorate reinforced Sousse's role as
                        a
                        commercial and administrative center by establishing public buildings, enlarging the city's
                        port, and building railways. Between 1896 and 1911, railways were built connecting Sousse
                        with Tunis, Kairouan, Sfax, Mahdia, Moknin, and Henshir Suwatir. Food industries were also
                        established in the city.

                        Before the First World War, Sousse had about 25,000 inhabitants, including around 10,000
                        French
                        and roughly 5,000 other Europeans, mostly Italians and Maltese. The port was the garrison of
                        the
                        4th Tunisian Rifle Regiment.

                        The first developments outside the medina walls were begun during this period, but they were
                        home to a relatively small number of people until after the Second World War. Sousse was
                        devastated by the war and suffered 39 bombardments between December 1942 and May 1943. In
                        1946, after the war was over, the authorities decided to give a high priority to
                        reconstruction
                        efforts in Sousse.</P>
                    <p>Modern Sousse</p>

                    <P> When Tunisia became independent in 1956, Sousse was made a wileya capital and it continued
                        to
                        expand in all directions.Over the course of the 20th century, its growth was explosive: from
                        just 8,577 residents in 1885, it had grown to 134,835 residents in 1994. Its physical area
                        had also increased massively, from a compact 29 hectares in 1881 to 3,100 hectares in 1992.
                        The secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy also grew accordingly.

                        Sousse has retained the Arabian look and feel it assumed in the centuries after its initial
                        conquest. Today it is considered one of the best examples of seaward-facing fortifications
                        built
                        by the Arabs. With a population of about 200,000, Sousse retains a medieval heart of narrow,
                        twisted streets, a kasbah and medina, its ribat fortress and long wall on the Mediterranean.
                        Surrounding it is a modern city of long, straight roads and more widely spaced buildings.

                        Sousse was the site of the chess interzonal in 1967, made famous when American Grandmaster
                        Bobby
                        Fischer withdrew from the tournament even though he was in first place at the time.

                        On 26 June 2015, a lone gunman, Seifeddine Rezgui Yacoubi, opened fire on tourists
                        sunbathing on
                        a beach near the Riu Imperial Marhaba and Soviva hotels, killing 38 and wounding 39, before
                        being shot dead by the police.</p>
